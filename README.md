# CHECK-FOR-PRIME-NUMBERS

Prime numbers are whole numbers that have only two factors: 1 and the number itself. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7.

For instance, 6 has four factors: 1, 2, 3, 6.
1 X 6 = 6
2 X 3 = 6
So we know 6 is not a prime number.

In the following coding environment, write code to check if the numbers provided in the list <strong>check_prime</strong> are prime numbers.

If the numbers are prime, the code should print "[number] is a prime number."
If the number is NOT a prime number, it should print "[number] is not a prime number", and a factor of that number, other than 1 and the number itself: "[factor] is a factor of [number]".

<strong>Example output:</strong>

7 IS a prime number
26 is NOT a prime number, because 2 is a factor of 26
